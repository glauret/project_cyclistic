# Context
Data Analysis Case Study for Google Data Analytics Certification - Cyclistic. Preparing a data analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders. 

# Project Overview
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team, my goal was to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Cyclicist is a bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.

We try to evaluate how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently:
- Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are considered casual riders.
- Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
